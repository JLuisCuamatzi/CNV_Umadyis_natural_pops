## Downloading

The links to download the `FASTQ` files were obtained from ENA browser.

The scripts `ena-file-download-read_run-PRJNA561077-fastq_ftp-20220710-2332.sh` and `ena-file-download-read_run-PRJNA674756-fastq_ftp-20220710-1640.sh` were automatically generated by the ENA browser when I clicked <b>Download All</b> while accessing the respective BioProject ID.

A `.txt` file containing the names of both `.sh` files was generated using:

```
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" | sed 's|^\./||' > Umaydis_sh2DownloadFastqFiles.txt
```

The Python script below was used to download the FASTQ files:

```
python3 ../scripts/01_DownloadFastqFiles.py -i Umaydis_sh2DownloadFastqFiles.txt
```

## FASTQ rename


The FASTQ files were renamed with the script `01_FastqRename.py` to identify them with the ID provided in the studies conducted by Schweizer <i>et al</i>., 2021 and Depotter <i>et al</i>., 2021.
